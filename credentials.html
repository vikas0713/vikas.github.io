                            <h3>Building IOT based Solutions using Aurdiono/ESP32 microcontrollers</h3>
                            <p>
                                My passion for technology extends into the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT), where I have developed several innovative projects using Arduino UNO and ESP32. These projects have allowed me to explore and implement cutting-edge solutions in automation, sensor integration, and wireless communication.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                My hands-on experience with these microcontrollers has equipped me with the skills to design, prototype, and deploy IoT systems that solve real-world problems. From home automation systems to environmental monitoring solutions, my projects showcase the versatility and potential of IoT technology.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to my personal projects, I am passionate about education and share my knowledge by teaching robotics to students. Through interactive and engaging lessons, I inspire the next generation of innovators, helping them understand the principles of robotics and IoT, and encouraging them to develop their own projects.
